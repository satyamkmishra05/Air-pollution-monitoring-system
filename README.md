This research proposed a smart air pollution monitoring system that constantly keeps track of air quality in an area and displays the air quality measured on an LCD screen the system helps to create awareness of the Quality of air that one breathes daily. This monitoring device can deliver real-time Measurements of air quality. The system to monitor the air of environment using Arduino microcontroller proposed to improve quality of air. Here the using of MQ135 gas sensor gives the sense of different type of dangerous gas and Arduino is the heart of this project which controls the entire process and LCD is used for the visual Output. The Automatic Air management system is a step forward to contribute a solution to the biggest threat.
